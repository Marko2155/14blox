# 14blox
Project to get the Roblox 2014 client back up and running.

## NOTICE
Discord signup has been deprecated in favor of on-client signup (so... can you please stop sending me fq's on discord constantly?)
as a prize for signing up for public beta, everyone who signs up before we go out of public beta gets free bobux and the exact amount of that robux in tix!
it will be a random amount from 900-1200

# searching for people (also no pay cause i'm broke on paypal):
people who can host multiple servers reliably on windows

css designers
